# Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the Notes & Tasks application to production.

## Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Prerequisites
- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- MongoDB Atlas cluster (production)

### Steps

1. **Push code to GitHub** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create new Railway project**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will use `railway.json` configuration automatically

3. **Set environment variables in Railway**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.netlify.app
   RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
   RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
   AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=5
   ```

4. **Generate JWT Secret**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy
   - Note your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Railway Configuration Files

`railway.json` is configured with:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && npm install"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

Backend automatically uses PORT from Railway environment.

## Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

### Prerequisites
- Netlify account (https://netlify.com)
- Railway backend URL from above

### Quick Start

1. **Connect GitHub to Netlify**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - **Important**: Clear any build command in UI (leave empty)
   - **Important**: Clear publish directory in UI (leave empty)
   - Netlify will automatically use `netlify.toml` configuration

2. **Set environment variable in Netlify**
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api`

3. **Update CORS in Railway**
   - Go back to Railway dashboard
   - Update `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable with your Netlify URL
   - Example: `https://your-app.netlify.app`

### Detailed Configuration

For comprehensive deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and optimization tips, see:
**[NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Netlify Configuration Features

The `netlify.toml` file provides:

**Build Configuration**:
- Base directory: `frontend`
- Publish directory: `build`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Node.js version: 20

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Precompression (gzip/brotli) enabled via SvelteKit adapter
- Aggressive caching for static assets (1 year)
- No caching for HTML files (always fresh)
- CDN distribution via Netlify's global network

**Security Headers**:
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- X-XSS-Protection (XSS filtering)
- Content-Security-Policy (resource loading restrictions)
- Referrer-Policy (referrer information control)
- Permissions-Policy (browser feature restrictions)

**SPA Routing**:
- All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing
- Enables deep linking and browser history support

## Local Development Testing

**Important**: Always test locally first using localhost URLs (not Railway).

1. **Test backend locally**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

2. **Test frontend locally**
   - Open http://localhost:8080
   - Register a new account
   - Create notes and tasks
   - Verify all features work

## Post-Deployment

### Test the deployment

1. **Test backend**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Test frontend**
   - Visit your Netlify URL
   - Register a new account
   - Create notes and tasks

### Update MongoDB Atlas

Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from:
- Railway IP addresses (or use `0.0.0.0/0` for all IPs)
- Your development IP (for local testing)

Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access → Add IP Address

## Environment Variables Reference

### Backend (Railway)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | Generated 64-char hex string |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Token expiration time | `7d` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment | `production` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` (Railway sets automatically) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed origins | `https://your-app.netlify.app` |

### Frontend (Netlify)

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Backend API URL | `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api` |

**Note**: Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"MongoDB connection failed"**
- Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
- Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`

**"CORS errors"**
- Verify CORS_ORIGINS matches your Netlify URL exactly
- Include the protocol (https://)
- Redeploy after changing environment variables

### Frontend Issues

**"Network error"**
- Check API_BASE_URL is set correctly
- Verify backend is running (test `/health` endpoint)
- Check browser console for CORS errors

**"404 on refresh"**
- Netlify should handle this with redirects
- Verify `netlify.toml` is in the repository root

## Custom Domains (Optional)

### Backend (Railway)
- Go to Railway project settings
- Add custom domain
- Update DNS records as instructed
- Update CORS_ORIGINS in environment variables

### Frontend (Netlify)
- Go to Netlify site settings → Domain management
- Add custom domain
- Configure DNS records
- SSL certificate is automatic

## Monitoring

### Railway
- View logs: Railway dashboard → Deployments → Logs
- View metrics: Railway dashboard → Metrics

### Netlify
- View analytics: Netlify dashboard → Analytics
- View logs: Netlify dashboard → Deploys → Deploy log

## CI/CD

Both platforms support automatic deployments:

- **Railway**: Automatically deploys on push to main branch
- **Netlify**: Automatically builds and deploys on push to main branch

Configure branch deploy previews in respective dashboards.

## Costs

- **Railway**: Free tier includes $5/month credits
- **Netlify**: Free tier includes 100GB bandwidth/month
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free M0 tier available

Both should be sufficient for development and small production apps.
